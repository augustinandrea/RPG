     A basic outline of how I am imagining the game will flow based on what I am
currently doing. Writing this so that input from group members can be made in
order to further refine the user inputs.

     1)
     The program starts. The user inputs characters. This would run the first
set of code in the file I have written.
     2)
     The character selection ends and the program moves on to the bulk of the
gameplay. Here, this would run the second block of code I have written, the
start of the players turn. Players would choose which character to interact with
. this owuld move right into:
     3)
     The character selected takes action. This would likely use the third block
of code that I have written where the user selects an action. From here, the
character can no longer act for the turn and the user selects another character
to act with, repeating phase 2.
     4)
     Once all characters have acted, the player's turn automatically ends. Then
an automated enemy turn is run. This leads back into the player's next turn,
starting phase 2 again.

    I'm not really sure what more user prompting there is to do. As such, I am
not entirely sure if there is more stuff that I should be doing with my code.
Really relying on group input here as to what I need to continue to do and what
I need to fix. Putting everything together is also a bit of an issue, as right
now, I just have several blocks of code. None of them really do anything on
their own. But they would be put together to do stuff with other group members'
stuff. So I'm not sure what else to do before the next meeting.

Problems:
Board bounds (in between 0 and 8 all around)
Enemy AI not implemented yet
If a character tries to move into another character, collision issues.
(?)Win condition happens after another action, then win is met.
Not really a big problem, passable, but would like to ideally change.
