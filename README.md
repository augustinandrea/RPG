Final Project Proposal

Description of the developing software
The software we want to develop is a text-based RPG (Role Playing Game). The game would specify to just the battle simulation part of an RPG. We will be using Github as our open source software repository to coordinate and cooperate on the project (https://github.com/pkwak1/DS_Project). Also, to make sure that the code stays organized, we will assign specific sections of code to each group member so that the project does not become cluttered. But we will also implement pair programming for certain sections of important code. During group meetings, we will all be discussing the same code as well just to make sure that everyone is on the same version, and page. We might possibly use semantic versioning with different branches to help with organization, but it may not be necessary.

Outline of our solution
The beginning menu would include starting the game, and then once the game has started, the user would be able to pick a playable character to use. Then it would randomize the opponent and place the user to the event they’ve been waiting for, the battle.
There will be multiple classes, each pertaining to a function that is necessary for an RPG battle. One class would be the menu for the battle sequence indicating whether to run, fight, or use items. There would be a class to keep track of the damage taken in battle.  There will be a class for the different characteristics of the playable characters, from how much damage each move does to the health they have. An item class that will have three different items that will either increase defense, attack or health. Also, to refer to different objects, we’ll be using a map data structure. This organization will help us refer to certain keys that refer to what specific object functions for what.

Special needs or concerns
We are concerned about whether the scope is just right, too little, or too much. We might also be looking for a special library that is focused on adding in ASCII images, but this is more optional, and more for the GUI aspect as well.
